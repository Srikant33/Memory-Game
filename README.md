## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I have not used any outside resources 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
The challenging part of this was understanding the connections between all the different functions in the JS file. To overcome it, clean indentation and orderly code,long with following the instructions helped me overcome the issue.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If JavaScript is such a powerful tool, why do many websites require a backend to perform functionality? It was able to handle complex code by itself.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would have included all the suggested additional work and along with that introduced a randomised functionality to change the pattern.
